Original Goal
-------------

The goal is testing a design for each component, footprint, and
production process for layered plate design.

- Use [Gateron Low-Profile switches](https://gateron.com/products/gateron-ks-33-low-profile-switch-set?VariantsId=10275)
  on [Hot-Swap socket](https://gateron.com/products/gateron-low-profile-switch-hot-swap-pcb-socket?VariantsId=10234).
- Use [Gateron Low-Profile 2U stabilizer](https://gateron.com/products/gateron-low-profile-plate-mounted-stabilizer?VariantsId=10478),
  which is top plate mount.
